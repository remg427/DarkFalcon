CAR-2013-01-002: Autorun Differences,CAR-2013-01-002,"The Sysinternals tool Autoruns checks the registry and file system for known identify persistence mechanisms. It will output any tools identified, including built-in or added-on Microsoft functionality and third party software. Many of these locations are known by adversaries and used to obtain Persistence. Running Autoruns periodically in an environment makes it possible to collect and monitor its output for differences, which may include the removal or addition of persistent tools. Depending on the persistence mechanism and location, legitimate software may be more likely to make changes than an adversary tool. Thus, this analytic may result in significant noise in a highly dynamic environment. While Autoruns is a convenient method to scan for programs using persistence mechanisms its scanning nature does not conform well to streaming based analytics. This analytic could be replaced with one that draws from sensors that collect registry and file information if streaming analytics are desired.",Autorun Differences,"T1031,T1050,T1053,T1013,T1060,T1034,T1015,T1112,T1058,T1084,T1035,T1042,T1037,T1004,T1103","Situational Awareness, TTP",https://car.mitre.org/wiki/CAR-2013-01-002
CAR-2013-01-003: SMB Events Monitoring,CAR-2013-01-003,"Server Message Block (SMB) is used by Windows to allow for file, pipe, and printer sharing over port 445/tcp. It allows for enumerating, and reading from and writing to file shares for a remote computer. Although it is heavily used by Windows servers for legitimate purposes and by users for file and printer sharing, many adversaries also use SMB to achieve Lateral Movement. Looking at this activity more closely to obtain an adequate sense of situational awareness may make it possible to detect adversaries moving between hosts in a way that deviates from normal activity. Because SMB traffic is heavy in many environments, this analytic may be difficult to turn into something that can be used to quickly detect an APT. In some cases, it may make more sense to run this analytic in a forensic fashion. Looking through and filtering its output after an intrusion has been discovered may be helpful in identifying the scope of compromise.",SMB Events Monitoring,"T1078,T1039,T1077",Situational Awareness,https://car.mitre.org/wiki/CAR-2013-01-003
CAR-2013-02-003: Processes Spawning cmd.exe,CAR-2013-02-003,"The Windows Command Prompt (cmd.exe) is a utility that provides a command line interface to Windows operating systems. It provides the ability to run additional programs and also has several built-in commands such as dir, copy,mkdir, and type, as well as batch scripts (.bat). 
Typically, when a user runs a command prompt, the parent process is explorer.exe or another instance of the prompt. There may be automated programs, logon scripts, or administrative tools that launch instances of the command prompt in order to run scripts or other built-in commands. Spawning the process cmd.exe from certain parents may be more indicative of malice.
For example, if Adobe Reader or Outlook launches a command shell, this may suggest that a malicious document has been loaded and should be investigated. Thus, by looking for abnormal parent processes of cmd.exe, it may be possible to detect adversaries.",Processes Spawning cmd.exe,T1059,Situational Awareness,https://car.mitre.org/wiki/CAR-2013-02-003
CAR-2013-02-008: Simultaneous Logins on a Host,CAR-2013-02-008,"Multiple users logged into a single machine at the same time, or even within the same hour, do not typically occur in networks we have observed.",Simultaneous Logins on a Host,T1078,Situational Awareness,https://car.mitre.org/wiki/CAR-2013-02-008
CAR-2013-02-012: User Logged in to Multiple Hosts,CAR-2013-02-012,"Most users use only one or two machines during the normal course of business. User accounts that log in to multiple machines, especially over a short period of time, may be compromised. Remote logins among multiple machines may be an indicator of lateral movement.",User Logged in to Multiple Hosts,T1078,Situational Awareness,https://car.mitre.org/wiki/CAR-2013-02-012
CAR-2013-03-001: Reg.exe called from Command Shell,CAR-2013-03-001,"Registry modifications are often essential in establishing persistence via known Windows mechanisms. Many legitimate modifications are done graphically via regedit.exe or by using the corresponding channels, or even calling the Registry APIs directly.
The built-in utility reg.exe provides a command-line interface to the registry, so that queries and modifications can be performed from a shell, such as cmd.exe.
When a user is responsible for these actions, the parent of cmd.exe will likely be explorer.exe. Occasionally, power users and administrators write scripts that do this behavior as well, but likely from a different process tree. These background scripts must be learned so they can be tuned out accordingly.",Reg.exe called from Command Shell,"T1012,T1112,T1060,T1058",TTP,https://car.mitre.org/wiki/CAR-2013-03-001
CAR-2013-04-002: Quick execution of a series of suspicious commands,CAR-2013-04-002,"Certain commands are frequently used by malicious actors and infrequently used by normal users. By looking for execution of these commands in short periods of time, we can not only see when a malicious user was on the system but also get an idea of what they were doing.",Quick execution of a series of suspicious commands,"T1087,T1003,T1069,T1057,T1077,T1050,T1031,T1112,T1058,T1018,T1035,T1053,T1029,T1033,T1007,T1082,T1049,T1016,T1010,T1063,T1046,T1089,T1098,T1054,T1059,T1012",TTP,https://car.mitre.org/wiki/CAR-2013-04-002
CAR-2013-05-002: Suspicious Run Locations,CAR-2013-05-002,"In Windows, files should never execute out of certain directory locations. Any of these locations may exist for a variety of reasons, and executables may be present in the directory but should not execute. As a result, some defenders make the mistake of ignoring these directories and assuming that a process will never run from one. There are known TTPs that have taken advantage of this fact to go undetected. This fact should inform defenders to monitor these directories more closely, knowing that they should never contain running processes.",Suspicious Run Locations,T1036,TTP,https://car.mitre.org/wiki/CAR-2013-05-002
CAR-2013-05-003: SMB Write Request,CAR-2013-05-003,"As described in CAR-2013-01-003: SMB Events Monitoring, SMB provides a means of remotely managing a file system. Adversaries often use SMB to move laterally to a host. SMB is commonly used to upload files. It may be used for staging in Exfiltration or as a Lateral Movement technique. Unlike SMB Reads, SMB Write requests typically require an additional level of access, resulting in less activity. Focusing on SMB Write activity narrows the field to find techniques that actively change remote hosts, instead of passively reading files.",SMB Write Request,"T1105,T1077,T1078","Situational Awareness,  TTP",https://car.mitre.org/wiki/CAR-2013-05-003
